Arya Portfolio Page 2.0
=======================
After a decent stretch of time since creating my previous portfolio website, which never reached completion, and especially
given that at the time of writing this, I am searching for a software development job, I decided that it was high time
to properly put together a portfolio/home page for myself. So here that is. Of course, as of right now, this is still a work in
progress, but I already feel *so* much better about this one than the last.

TODO

A list of planned features to add to the page, that it does not already have, but are thought out or already in development.

* User login/authentication.
* Blog post creation page, isolated to my personal account.
* Ability for users to sign up for email or webhook notifications for a new blog post.

Future Plans
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Plans that are just ideas for now, a little far away from actually getting worked on.

* Get youtube videos and show them on a page (requires me to get back into making youtube content)
* Notifications for those videos ^^
* Ability to add project page directly from a github repo (requires some custom markdown processing for getting it to look nice)
* Ability to add blog posts from a markdown file format instead of having to make its own ``.tsx`` file.
